# Data Visualization - ADA 2019 Tutorial

---

#### What do you find in this notebook ?

The purpose of the Notebook is to offer a **quick** overview on how to use [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) / [`Seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and how to build maps with [`Folium`](https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In details, we go through the basics of the `folium` API, then apply these methods to a simple visualization of the results of the 2016 US presidential election.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive documentation of the libraries, their features or their API, but can be useful to get started with the Python visualization ecosystem.
